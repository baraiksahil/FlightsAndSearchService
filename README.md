# Welcome to my flight service

## Project Setup

- clone the project on your local
- Execute `npm install` on the same path as your root directory of downloaded project
- Create a `.env` file in root directory and add the following environment variable

- Inside the `src/config` folder create a new file `config.json` and then add the following piece of json

```
{
    "development": {
    "username": "<YOUR_USER_NAME>",
    "password": "<YOUR_PASSWORD>",
    "database": "<YOUR_DB_NAME>",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "mysql"
    }
}
```

## DB Design

    - Airplane
    - Flight
    - City
    - Airport

    - A flight belongs to a airplane but one airplane can be used in multiple flights
    - A city has many airports but one airport belongs to a city
    - One airport can have many flights, but a flight belongs to one airport
